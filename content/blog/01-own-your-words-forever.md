# Own Your Words. Forever.

In 2023, a writer with 50,000 followers on Medium woke up to find her account suspended. No warning. No explanation. Years of work—hundreds of articles, thousands of hours—gone in an instant. Her crime? An algorithm flagged something. Nobody could tell her what.

This story repeats daily across the internet. Platforms delete accounts. Companies shut down. Terms of service change. The content you created, the audience you built, the reputation you earned—all of it exists at the mercy of corporations whose interests rarely align with yours.

We built Vauban to end this.

## The Problem With Digital Publishing Today

When you publish on Medium, Substack, or WordPress.com, you're not really publishing. You're renting space. The platform owns the servers, controls the database, and can revoke your access whenever they choose.

Consider what you actually own:

| Platform | Your Content | Your Audience | Your Revenue | Your Data |
|----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| Medium | ❌ License | ❌ Followers | 💰 Split | ❌ Theirs |
| Substack | ⚠️ Portable | ✅ Email list | 💰 10% fee | ⚠️ Partial |
| WordPress.com | ⚠️ Export | ❌ Platform | 💰 Varies | ⚠️ Partial |
| **Vauban** | ✅ Yours | ✅ Yours | ✅ 85%+ | ✅ Yours |

The web promised us ownership. Social media took it away. We're taking it back.

## What Does "Own Your Words" Actually Mean?

On Vauban, when you publish an article, something fundamentally different happens:

1. **Your content is stored permanently on Arweave**—a decentralized storage network designed to last 200+ years. No company can delete it. No server shutdown affects it. It exists as long as the internet exists.

2. **A cryptographic hash is recorded on the blockchain**—proving you wrote it, when you wrote it, and that it hasn't been tampered with. This is your digital signature, immutable and eternal.

3. **You hold the keys**—literally. Your wallet is your identity. No email verification, no password resets, no "we've updated our terms." Your cryptographic keys are yours alone.

This isn't theoretical. When you publish on Vauban, your article receives:
- An Arweave transaction ID (permanent storage)
- An IPFS content identifier (fast global access)
- A SHA256 hash on Starknet L3 (tamper-proof verification)

Try deleting that. You can't. Neither can we.

## But Why Does Permanence Matter?

"I don't need my tweets to last forever," you might think. Fair enough. But consider:

**For journalists**: Your investigation into corruption can't be silently removed when powerful people complain. The public record remains public.

**For researchers**: Your data, methodology, and findings are permanently citable. No more broken links in academic papers.

**For artists**: Your creative work is timestamped and attributed. Plagiarism becomes provable, not just claimable.

**For historians**: Future generations can access primary sources, not just what platforms decided to preserve.

**For you**: The blog post you write today can still be read by your grandchildren. Your digital legacy is actually... a legacy.

## The Technology, Without the Complexity

We know what you're thinking. "Blockchain? Crypto wallets? This sounds complicated."

It's not. Here's what using Vauban actually looks like:

1. Click "Connect Wallet" (one-time setup)
2. Write your article in a familiar Markdown editor
3. Click "Publish"
4. That's it.

Behind the scenes, we handle the blockchain transactions, the decentralized storage, the content verification. You just write.

When readers engage with your content—liking, commenting, following—they don't even need to pay gas fees. Our session key system makes Web3 feel like Web2, except you actually own everything.

## A Fair Deal for Writers

Traditional platforms built empires on your content while giving you pennies. Vauban inverts this:

```
When someone pays for your article:
├── You receive: 85%
├── Platform: 10% (keeps the lights on)
└── Referrer: 5% (rewards sharing)
```

No algorithm deciding if you deserve to be shown. No platform taking half before you see a dime. Your work, your earnings, your control.

## This Is Just the Beginning

Vauban isn't just a blogging platform. It's a statement about what the internet should be:

- **Open**: Anyone can read, anyone can write
- **Owned**: Your content, your audience, your data
- **Permanent**: What you create endures
- **Fair**: Value flows to creators, not platforms
- **Trustworthy**: Cryptographic proof, not corporate promises

We're building the publishing infrastructure for the next century. Not because blockchain is trendy, but because writers deserve better than what exists today.
