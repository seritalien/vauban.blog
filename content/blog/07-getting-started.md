# Getting Started: Your First Article on Vauban

Ready to own your words forever? This guide walks you through publishing your first article on Vauban—from zero to permanent publication in about 15 minutes.

## What You'll Need

1. **A wallet**: ArgentX or Braavos (both are free)
2. **Something to write**: A draft, an idea, or just follow along
3. **15 minutes**: That's all it takes

No cryptocurrency required. No payment needed. Just your words.

## Step 1: Get a Wallet (5 minutes)

If you already have ArgentX or Braavos, skip to Step 2.

A wallet is your digital identity on Vauban. It's like a username and password, except only you control it—no company can lock you out.

### Option A: ArgentX (Recommended for Beginners)

1. Visit [argent.xyz](https://argent.xyz)
2. Click "Download" and add the browser extension
3. Create a new wallet
4. Write down your recovery phrase (keep it safe!)
5. Set a password

Done. You now have a Starknet wallet.

### Option B: Braavos

1. Visit [braavos.app](https://braavos.app)
2. Click "Download" and add the extension
3. Create a new wallet
4. Secure your recovery phrase
5. Set a password

Both wallets are excellent. Pick whichever feels more intuitive.

### Important Security Note

Your recovery phrase (12 or 24 words) is the master key to your wallet. Anyone with these words controls your account.

- ✅ Write it on paper
- ✅ Store in a safe place
- ❌ Don't save it digitally
- ❌ Never share it
- ❌ No legitimate service will ever ask for it

## Step 2: Connect to Vauban (30 seconds)

1. Go to [vauban.blog](https://vauban.blog)
2. Click **"Connect Wallet"** in the top right
3. Choose ArgentX or Braavos
4. Approve the connection in your wallet popup

You're now connected! Your wallet address appears in the header.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Profile (2 minutes)

Before publishing, let's create your author identity.

1. Click your address in the header
2. Select **"Dashboard"**
3. Click **"Edit Profile"**
4. Fill in:
   - **Display Name**: How readers will see you (e.g., "Jane Smith")
   - **Bio**: A short description (e.g., "Tech writer. Building in public.")
   - **Profile Picture**: Upload or paste an image URL

5. Click **"Save Profile"**
6. Approve the transaction in your wallet

Your profile is now on-chain. It belongs to you, not us.

## Step 4: Create Your First Article (5-10 minutes)

Now the fun part—writing!

### Navigate to the Editor

1. From your Dashboard, click **"New Post"**
2. Or go directly to [vauban.blog/dashboard/new](/dashboard/new)

### Write Your Content

The editor uses Markdown—a simple formatting language. Here's a quick guide:

```markdown
# This is a heading

## This is a subheading

This is a paragraph. You can write naturally.

**This text is bold** and *this is italic*.

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2

1. Numbered list
2. Like this

[This is a link](https://example.com)

![This is an image](https://example.com/image.png)

> This is a quote

`This is inline code`
```

Don't worry about perfecting the formatting—focus on your message.

### Fill in Metadata

Below the editor, you'll see:

- **Title**: Your article headline (max 100 characters)
- **Slug**: The URL path (auto-generated from title)
- **Excerpt**: A short summary for previews (optional, 300 chars)
- **Cover Image**: Upload or paste URL (optional)
- **Tags**: Select up to 5 relevant tags

### For Your First Article

Keep it simple:
- Write about something you know
- 500-1000 words is plenty
- Share an opinion, teach something, or tell a story

The goal is to experience the publishing flow, not to write a masterpiece.

## Step 5: Preview and Publish

### Preview Your Work

Click **"Preview"** to see how your article will look to readers. Check:
- Formatting looks correct
- Images display properly
- Title and excerpt work

### Submit for Review

As a new writer, your first articles need Editor approval. This typically takes less than 24 hours.

1. Click **"Submit for Review"**
2. Confirm in the dialog
3. Approve the transaction in your wallet

Your article is now:
- ✅ Uploaded to Arweave (permanent storage)
- ✅ Pinned to IPFS (fast access)
- ✅ Hash recorded on blockchain (verification)
- ⏳ Waiting for Editor review

### What Happens Next

An Editor will review your submission and either:
- **Approve**: Your article goes live immediately
- **Request revision**: You'll see feedback and can resubmit
- **Reject**: Rare, usually only for spam or policy violations

Most sincere submissions are approved within 24 hours.

## Step 6: Track Your Submission

While waiting, you can check status:

1. Go to **Dashboard → My Posts**
2. Find your article
3. See the status badge:
   - 🟡 Pending Review
   - 🟢 Published
   - 🟠 Needs Revision
   - 🔴 Rejected

You'll also receive a notification when the status changes.

## Step 7: Celebrate Your First Publication!

Once approved, your article is:

- **Permanently stored** on Arweave (survives forever)
- **Verified on-chain** (tamper-proof)
- **Discoverable** on Vauban's homepage and search
- **Yours** (cryptographically signed by your wallet)

Share the link! Your article URL will look like:
```
vauban.blog/articles/your-article-slug
```

## What's Next?

### Build Your Audience

- Share your article on social media
- Include your Vauban profile link in your bio
- Engage with other writers (comments, likes)
- Publish consistently

### Earn Contributor Status

After 5 approved articles:
- You can publish directly (no review needed)
- Edit your published articles
- Access detailed analytics

### Set Up Paid Content

Once you're comfortable:
- Toggle "Paid Content" when writing
- Set your price
- Receive 85% of each sale

### Explore the Platform

- Follow writers you enjoy
- Join conversations in comments
- Build your reputation
- Consider becoming a Moderator

## Common Questions

### Do I need cryptocurrency?

No. Gas fees are covered by the platform (session keys + paymaster). You can read, write, comment, and like without spending anything.

### What if I make a mistake in my article?

As a Writer, you can edit drafts before submission. After publication, you'll need to reach Contributor status to edit, or ask an Editor for help.

### Can my article be deleted?

Content on Arweave is permanent. However, the Vauban frontend can hide content that violates policies. The content itself still exists on Arweave—it just won't appear on our site.

### What if I lose access to my wallet?

Use your recovery phrase to restore your wallet on any device. If you lose the phrase, you lose access—there's no "forgot password" option. This is the tradeoff for true ownership.

### How long until my article is approved?

Most submissions are reviewed within 24 hours. Complex or longer articles may take slightly longer.

### What if my article is rejected?

Rejections include a reason. Common issues:
- Incomplete or too short
- Spam or promotional content
- Policy violations

You can revise and resubmit. Rejections aren't permanent marks—they're learning opportunities.
